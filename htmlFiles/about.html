            <p>
                I completed bachelors degree in <strong>computer science </strong>in May 2020 from <em>california state university, Northridge, California</em>.
                After graduation, I got this opportunity to work as an software developer intern at a company called <strong>Yeti Global Tech Solutions</strong>.
                while working there, my main role was to participate in the software development process and collaborate with other team members in writing
                code, analyzing business logic and testing the software. I learned invaluable industry experience from this job.
                Currently I am training for <strong>Full Stack Java developer</strong> with <em>Per-Scholas</em>. <br>
                I am passionate about software development. My goal is to start contributing for a dynamic software company and advance my career in software development.
                Being a non-native, I have a different mental model and can see problems from a different perspective.
                Hence, I could bring diversity in the team. On top that having an academic background in computer science I have a good 
                understanding of computer fundamentals and networks which makes me a significant asset to any team.<br>
                While I am not working, I like to spend time with my family, read books, play video games and watch soccer games.
